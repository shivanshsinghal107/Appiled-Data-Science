## LEARNINGS FROM INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE

The best thing about this course is that the instructor do not teach upto the extent at which they give the Programming assignments, so you have to search for everything to get the assignment questions correct & that is approximately same as if you're learning things by referencing documentations, stackoverflow, trying to get the code for specific work by searching query on Google. And that's the best way to learn things according to me.

I would definitely recommend this course for those who want to learn **Data Cleansing**, **Data Manipulation**, **Pandas** or **Numpy**.

This is first course of **Applied Data Science with Python Specialization** from ***Coursera***.
